events:
  event_name: # event name, needs to be the same as in api
    intensity: 50 # [0-100]
    duration: 5 # seconds, decimal values with 1 decimal place are allowed
  # setting intensity to 0 will stop vibrations 
  # setting duration to 0 will make the vibration last forever (5 minutes) or until an event with 0 intensity is sent, useful for games that you need to be revived
